####### Filters the TE-TE hits
####### As there are too many hits to process in a single table, we first filter-out all hits whose pID (not Ks) is lower than the 1 - the 0.5% quantile of Ks of the corresponding clade pair. Hits not passing this flter would have been very unlikey to pass downsteam filters based on TE Ks

tree = read.tree("timetree.nwk")
mrcaMat = mrca(tree)										#matrix of mrcas for each pair of species

#we add this quantile to for every species pair that was blasted
pairs = fread("pairsToBlastn.txt", select = c(1,2, 8))		#pairs of species whose TEs were compared by blast, generated in 4-blastTEs.R
pairs[, q := 100 - 100 * quant[match(mrcaMat[cbind(sp1, sp2)], clade), q]]						#adds a column indicating the minimum pID to retain blast hits

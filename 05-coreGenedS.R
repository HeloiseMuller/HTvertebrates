# the principle of the approach is described in Peccoud et al. 2017 PNAS


# this script uses the fasta files of complete BUSCO genes in each species in a "Busco" folder 
# (The BUSCO pipeline was not automated in scripts)

# example of BUSCO run (launched from bash with version >= 5.4.0:
# busco -i genomes/GCA_xxx.fa -o Busco/GCA_xxx_busco -l database/busco/yyy/ -m genome -c 1
# where yyy is the busco database associated with the genome of GCA_xxx. It should be the database which is as precise as possible (eg aves instead of metazoa)
# ATTENTION after busco was ran one 1 genome, make sure the outputs of interest are there:
  # Busco/GCA_xxx_busco/run_yyy/busco_sequences/single_copy_busco_sequence/zzz.fna
  # Busco/GCA_xxx_busco/run_yyy/busco_sequences/single_copy_busco_sequence/zzz.faa
  # where zzz is the name of the busco gene
# In my case there was no .fna because of a bug that has been fixed in v5.4.0Â 

# The steps of this script are
  # Step 1: retrieve BUSCO sequences and do similirity seach
  # Step 2: compute dN & dS

# the final outputs of this script 5 are:
# - dS/dNdS/dS100AA_filterBusco_median.txt :
  # a tabular file of dN and dS median values for pairs of BUSCO genes
# - dSdistribution_of_BUSCO_overTime.pdf: figure of the correlation between dS and divergence time of species 

# An important intermediate file that will be used a lot latter in the piepleine is pairsALL.txt
# This table contains all the possible pairs of species (for which we looked for HTT or not) including species against itself
# Its nrow = ((nSpecies * nSpecies - nSpecies) / 2) + nSpecies, where nSpecies is the number of species in the dataset

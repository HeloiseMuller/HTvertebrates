# STEP ONE, we select the hits and delineate the scope of permutations -------------------------------------------

# we import the hit representing htt
retainedHits <- fread("supplementary-data4-retained_hits.txt")

# as several species are involved in a hit group even though this would just represent one transfer, 
# we only retain the two species for the best hit (best pID) per hit group. We also replace their 
# names with tip numbers of the tree, as integer numbers speed things up and save memory considerably

# we put the best hits on top 
setorder(retainedHits, -pID)

# so we extract the one we one (note that we only consider "independent" transfers)
# and we replace species names with tip numbers at the same time
HTThits <- retainedHits[independent == T, .(
    sp1 = chmatch(sp1[1], tree$tip.label),
    sp2 = chmatch(sp2[1], tree$tip.label),
    repl = 0L
    # repl is a replicate number (= 0 for original, non-permuted species)
), by = .(hitgroup, superfamily)]


# we determine the scope of permutations. Ideally, we permute species involved in htt within a TE super family, 
# but some contain too few HTT for this to be meaningful, 
# and others contain too many, which makes impossible to obtain only "legal permutations"
# to make our choices, we compute the number of independent transfers per super family, 
nTr <- HTThits[, .N, by = superfamily]

# we add a column to denote the TE class we pool super families (within TE classes) that are involved in less than 20 transfers
nTr[, class := ifelse(grepl("CMC|hAT|Mariner|Maverick|Merlin|PIF|PiggyBac", superfamily),

                         no = superfamily)]

# we replace names of underrepresented super families with the combined names
HTThits[, superfamily2 := nTr[chmatch(HTThits$superfamily, superfamily), combined]]

# we recompute the numbers of transfers with the pooled super families
nTr <- nTr[, .(N = sum(N)), by = combined]

# as there may be too many hits per superfamily to obtain only "legal" permutations, 
# we will split certain super families in batches of hits (when they encompass more than 120 transfers)
# we add a column for the number of time a superfamily has been seen in a transfer
HTThits[, occ := occurrences(superfamily)]

# we compute the max number of transfers we allow per superfamily batch

# (for some reason, it is harder to obtain legal permutations in these TEs)

# Note that we anticipate 10^5 permutations per batch, although we keep much fewer. 
# This is because many permutations may be "illegal".
# The row indices of this matrix = the original species (integer ids)
